#wordcloudifier
Python application and deployment for wordcloud-ifying some input text

TODO:
Sort out the webification of the program. Works in venv but not on local machine despite having requirements installed.

Permissions issue? Path problem? "wordcloud" should be on the path already - what is difference between venv and host that is causing this?

Dockerize

Dockerhub

Deploy to Heroku?

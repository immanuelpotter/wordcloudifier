#wordcloudifier
Python application and deployment for wordcloud-ifying some input text

TODO:

Sort out the webification of the program. Works in venv but not on local machine despite having requirements installed (it works on my machine!)... Probably missed something so will revisit this

Permissions issue? Path problem? "wordcloud" should be on the path already - what is difference between venv and host that is causing this?
